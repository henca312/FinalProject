Project Motivation
==========
In this project i'am going to analyze AirBNB Data from Boston AirBNB homes. Since 2008 guest and hosts have used to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside Initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Boston, MA.

We have 3 Questions that we want to focus:
* What are the main criteria that influences the height of the price? (Q1)
* What homes have the hightes price? (Q2)
* What homes have the lowest price? (Q3)

The goal is to develop a model that can be used to predict the price based on the criterias of the listing.
