Project Motivation
In this project i'am going to analyze AirBNB Data from Boston AirBNB homes. Since 2008 guest and hosts have used to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside Initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Boston, MA.

We have 3 Questions that we want to focus:

What are the main criteria that influences the height of the price? (Q1)
What homes have the hightes price? (Q2)
What homes have the lowest price? (Q3)
The goal is to develop a model that can be used to predict the price based on the criterias of the listing.
