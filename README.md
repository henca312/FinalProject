Project Motivation
==========
In this project i'am going to use all my gained knowledge while doing the data scientist nanodegree at udacity in the Capstone Project. I've started my journey as a Business Intelligence Consultant a few years ago. Several projects and years past. One day i’ve reminded me of the experience i’ve gained and the power of business analytic tools. A few months ago i’ve started my data scientist nanodegree to discover the whole potential of analytical techologies. Now the time has come to put all together what i’ve learned in this course.

The project is separated into different phases:
1 What is going on? Get to know the data!
2 Customer Segmentation Report
3 Supervised Model
4 Kaggle Competition
To have a solid and well known project structure i’ve used the CRISPDM process (https://datasolut.com/crisp-dm-standard/) to accomplish all of these tasks. The CRISPDM process contains the following phases:
* Business Understandning
* Data Understanding
* Data Preparation
* Data Modeling
* Evaluation
* Deployment
